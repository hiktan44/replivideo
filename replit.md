# AI Avatar Video Maker

## Overview

AI Avatar Video Maker is a FastAPI-based web application that automatically generates Turkish tutorial videos (5, 10, or 15 minutes) from **any website or GitHub repository**. The system analyzes web content, generates professional Turkish scripts using AI, creates voiceovers, and combines them with AI avatar videos or screen recordings to produce complete educational content.

The application provides a REST API and web interface for submitting any web URL (including GitHub repositories) and monitoring video creation progress in real-time. Users can also **upload their own photo to create a personalized talking avatar** that appears in a circular frame at the video corner with lip-sync and facial expressions.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

**Critical Issue - API Quota Management** (Oct 10 - Evening):
- ⚠️ ElevenLabs quota critically low (2204 credits remaining)
- ⚠️ Demo mode fallback creates empty 5-second videos with no audio/visuals
- ⚠️ Users experiencing: 5-second blank videos with no sound or avatar
- 🔧 **Recommended**: Use Replit integrations for better API key management
- 🔧 **Immediate fix**: Top up ElevenLabs credits or switch to alternative TTS

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: FastAPI
- RESTful API with async/await patterns for concurrent operations
- CORS middleware enabled for cross-origin requests
- Background task processing for video generation pipeline
- In-memory database (`videos_db` dictionary) for storing video metadata and status

**Video Generation Pipeline**: Multi-stage asynchronous workflow
1. **Content analysis** - Auto-detects and analyzes GitHub repos OR general websites
2. AI script generation (10-minute Turkish tutorial)
3. Text-to-speech audio generation
4. Avatar video creation with lip-sync
5. Video composition and finalization

**Service Layer Architecture**: Modular service-based design
- `GitHubAnalyzer`: Repository content extraction and analysis (GitHub-specific)
- `WebsiteAnalyzer`: General web content extraction using BeautifulSoup
- `ContentAnalyzer`: Unified router that auto-detects URL type and delegates to appropriate analyzer
- `AIService`: Script generation using OpenAI or Anthropic (supports both GitHub and website content)
- `ElevenLabsService`: Turkish text-to-speech conversion
- `ScreenRecorderService`: Playwright-based browser automation for screen recording (NEW - Oct 10)
- `HeyGenService`: AI avatar video generation with HeyGen
- `DIDService`: AI avatar video generation with D-ID
- `VideoComposer`: Final video assembly and composition (supports both avatar and screen recording modes)

**Graceful Degradation**: Demo mode fallbacks when API keys are unavailable
- Each service checks for API key availability on initialization
- Falls back to demo/placeholder content when keys are missing
- Allows development and testing without all API credentials

### Frontend Architecture

**Interface**: Simple web UI served via FastAPI
- HTML/JavaScript-based interface
- Real-time progress tracking via polling or WebSocket
- Static file serving for videos and assets
- File download capability for generated videos

### Data Storage

**Primary Storage**: Persistent JSON file with in-memory cache (`videos_db`)
- Video metadata: ID, status, progress, timestamps
- Progress tracking: current stage, completion percentage
- Results: video URLs, YouTube URLs (future feature)
- Thread-safe access using asyncio.Lock for concurrent operations
- Automatic persistence to `videos_db.json` file
- Error state management

**File Storage**: Local filesystem
- Video outputs stored in `videos/` directory
- Demo assets stored in `demo_assets/` directory
- Generated audio files: `videos/audio_{voice_type}.mp3`
- Final videos: `videos/final_{video_id}.mp4`

**Future Enhancement Consideration**: Comment suggests migration to Replit DB for persistence

### Authentication & Authorization

**Current Implementation**: No authentication
- Public API endpoints
- Open access for MVP/demo purposes

**API Key Management**: Environment variable based
- Service-level API key validation
- Keys stored in `.env` file
- Separate keys for each external service

### Video Processing Architecture

**Script Generation Strategy**: AI-powered content creation
- Bilingual support: OpenAI or Anthropic as providers
- Turkish language optimization
- Structured prompt engineering for 10-minute video format (1500-1800 words)
- **Dual content type support**:
  - **GitHub repos**: Integrates repository metadata (stars, forks, language, README)
  - **General websites**: Extracts title, description, headings, main content, and links
- Dynamic prompt generation based on content type

**Audio Generation Strategy**: Professional Turkish voiceovers
- ElevenLabs multilingual v2 model
- Multiple voice options (professional/friendly, male/female)
- MP3 output at 44.1kHz, 128kbps
- Text truncation at 5000 characters for API limits

**Avatar Video Strategy**: D-ID lip-sync technology
- Pre-configured avatar image URLs for different personas
- Microsoft Azure neural voices for Turkish (tr-TR-EmelNeural)
- Text truncation at 500 characters per clip
- Multiple avatar types: professional/casual, male/female

**Composition Strategy**: FFmpeg-based VideoComposer service
- **Real video composition using FFmpeg** (implemented Oct 9, 2025)
- Concatenates D-ID avatar clips using FFmpeg concat demuxer
- Muxes ElevenLabs narration audio with AAC encoding
- QuickTime compatibility via `-movflags +faststart`
- Async subprocess execution to keep service responsive
- Graceful fallback to demo mode if FFmpeg fails
- Automatic temp file cleanup after composition
