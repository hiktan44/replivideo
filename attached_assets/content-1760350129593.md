Create talking head videos from just text or audio, to make business content more cost-effective, engaging and human. Speaking Portrait (Talks endpoint) allows users to create a realistic video of a human presenter, without any video production. Simply input an image and either text or an audio file, and a video is automagically created by our AI-based reenactment technology. Transform articles, training materials, corporate communications, and product marketing materials into videos, at scale, without the need for costly productions and studios.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Example \#6: Drivers   [Skip link to ‚ú¥Ô∏è Example \#6: Drivers](https://docs.d-id.com/reference/talks-overview\#%EF%B8%8F-example-6-drivers)

**"Driver"** is a video of a real human face, filmed behind the scenes, that controls the facial and head movements of the speaking output video. There are several different drivers that can be used when creating a **`Talks`** request. By default, (when not providing a `driver_url` field in the request body), the system automatically chooses the best-matched driver for the input photo. However, in order to manually force a different and specific driver to the request to diverse the head movements, you can provide one of the following drivers under the **`driver_url`** field.
