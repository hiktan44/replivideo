Whether you need videos for _education, entertainment, or marketing_, the **HeyGen API** makes it simple and efficient.

## 1\. Get List of Avatars and Voices   [Skip link to 1. Get List of Avatars and Voices](https://docs.heygen.com/docs/create-video\#1-get-list-of-avatars-and-voices)

To generate an avatar video, you'll need an **avatar** and a **voice**. You can fetch a list of available avatars and voices. For this we need to use [List Avatars](https://docs.heygen.com/reference/list-avatars-v2) and [List Voices](https://docs.heygen.com/reference/get-voices) API endpoints.

### List Avatars   [Skip link to List Avatars](https://docs.heygen.com/docs/create-video\#list-avatars)

[See detailed API reference](https://docs.heygen.com/reference/list-avatars-v2)

Use this API to obtain a list of available **avatars**, including your **instant avatars**. This API call will provide you with a list of avatars. Choose one avatar from the list and note down its `avatar_id` for the next steps.

RequestResponse

```rdmd-code lang-shell theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

### List Voices   [Skip link to List Voices](https://docs.heygen.com/docs/create-video\#list-voices)

[See detailed API reference](https://docs.heygen.com/reference/list-voices-v2)

```

Assuming you've selected an **avatar** and a **voice**, let's proceed to generate your video.

## 2\. Generate Video   [Skip link to 2. Generate Video](https://docs.heygen.com/docs/create-video\#2-generate-video)

You'll receive a `video_id` in the response. Note down this ID as you will need it to check the video's generation status.

## 3\. Check Video Generation Status   [Skip link to 3. Check Video Generation Status](https://docs.heygen.com/docs/create-video\#3-check-video-generation-status)

[See detailed API reference](https://docs.heygen.com/reference/video-status)

After creating your video, you can check its status. Wait until the video's status changes to **completed**.

RequestResponse (Completed)Response (Waiting)Response (Processing)Response (Pending)Response (Failed)

```rdmd-code lang-shell theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

```

When the video generation is complete, the status will change to **completed**, and you will receive the video's URL.
